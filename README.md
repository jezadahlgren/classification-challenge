Module 13 Challenge

**Name:
Module 13 Challenge: classification-challenge

**Description:
This is an analysis of Internet Service Provbide data that is looking to classify spam emails using two different models: logistic regression and random forest.  Once each model is use to predict outcomes each model is compared for accuracy.  

**Support: 
The bulk of support was provide through class lessons 

**Libraries imported: 
    - pandas
    - sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
    - sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

** Data analysis process:
The data was trained, tested and split then standardized to create two classification models: logistic regression and random forest. Each model was then compared for accuracy score to determine which model would best predict if emails were spam or not spam.  

**Conclusion:
The accuracy score of the random forest model was slightly better than the logistic (.96 VS .92).
